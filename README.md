## Reading
I am an avid reader, and I try to read as much as I can when I have the time! I've been busy recently, so I've been reading less, sadly, but my love for reading still reigns. I think I truly appreciated reading was when I was in first grade reading the Magic Tree House series. I love fantasy, romance, and thriller. Harry Potter is one of my favorite series (fellow Hufflepuffs where you at), and I am currently reading Crying in H Mart. ![Image](https://pixahive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Book-aesthetic-219430-pixahive.jpg)
## Music
I play piano and sing, and I've been learning piano and singing since I was six years old! My favorite [song](https://youtu.be/rFjJs6ZjPe8) at the moment is "Mr. Perfectly Fine" by Taylor Swfit!
